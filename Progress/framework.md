7. dry run  [TIME : ]
    1. ask the interviewer :
        1. do you want specific tc to dry run, 
            1. yes, gives a big tc : 
                1. start detailed dry run for very short while, then jump through the dry run and mention:
                    'I will jump through iterations for the sake of time'
            2. yes, gives a small tc : goto step 7.1.1.1.1
            3. No
                1. try smallest case : step 7.1.1.1.1
                2. try small corner cases : step 7.1.1.1.1
                3. [optional] : try interesting edge case : step 7.1.1.1.1
                4. [optional] : try long edge case : step 7.1.1.1.1

6. explain : line by line explain the code
    1. first explain method wise
    2. then explain how methods are stiched
5 One Scan : [TIME : ]
    1. THIS IS VERY IMP. FOR YOU TO MENTALLY SOLVE CASES AND SEE CODE CORRECTNESS. AFTER THIS ANY MISTAKE FOUND IS A NEGATIVE MARK. 
    2. check hotspot ( and dry run in MIND)
    3. check variables, braces, ; , other syntaxes (all these per line). Speak : 'Now IM CHECKING FOR SYNTAX ERRORS'
4 start coding [TIME : ]
    1. try to use pseudo code's steps to decorate parts of code e.g. code sections or methods...AFTER that part is coded
    2. [optional] : whenever feel like some twisted logic is, add one liner comment 
    3. comment on top of each method on its role...also comment how multiple methods are linked
3. write and touch upon ideas one by one: [TIME : ]
    1. How many approaches are coming to you? 
        If only one, 
            Take some time (30s) to think more. 
            If still not able to think second. stop. and say it.(steps + TC + DS)
        If many ways are coming to you. 
            write 1-2 words against it in notepad.
            think which one is easier to do. say that with (steps + TC, DS + AQ)
    2. IF interviewer insists on more optimal or a diff approach:
        if the approach you ALREADY know, pause few seconds, act, then say it with (steps + TC + DS + AQ)
        if you dont know the approach : take 1-2 min, think deep (CRITICAL)
            if cant find a way, speak your line of thought
            if you can find a way, speak line of thought + say the approach with (steps + TC + DS + AQ)
        At the end of this step, one of below will happen
            1 Interviewer will ask you for another (more optimal or diff) approach -> go to step 3.2
            2. you and you interviewer will AGREE on the approach -> go to step 4
            3 you will not find best approach, but interviewer will ask you to code suboptimal one -> goto step 4
            4 interviewer will move to next qs or drop the interview -> NA
2. [TIME : ]
    1. ask and write size constrainst
    2. ask and write data types
    3. ask and write corner cases and output
1 write qs key points [TIME : ]



AQ = Approach question = "i think this is most optimal that i can think of. are you looking for any specific approach?"


intro : I am Anirban, a enginner at Microsoft, leading a team of 5 in Project Operations Time Entry module developing Agentic ERP systems. Before this I was at cohesity where I joined (after Graduating from IIT Roorkee)to work on enterprise backup restore where my work is filed for a patent. Love to travel, paint. Looking forward to this conversation.

If probed : MSFT : latest work Time Agent is one of first agents introduced by Satya in KeyNote.
