cpp code readability : interviewer will not know what happens in certain complicated codes, explain:

confused between dp vs greedy : could not come up with a case when greedy would fail. But i knew dp would work for all cases.
To interviewer it felt like I had memorized the code.

i didnt ask data type, it was int or double

my words and the things i write do not connect. To interviewer, its hard to stay connected or understand what Im saying or thinking. He will get confused.

while telling complexity I fumbled. 
TO ME : i could not visualize the code, but started speaking
TO interviewer : candidate does not have clarity : FAIL.
