code was not commented ...he didnt know which function did what





1. increase readability by adding comments:
    code needs to be commented, describe what method does, big step does
2. Put edge cases before coding, ask him if he wants to any edge cases
3. interviewer concentration span is less, if asks a question directly drive him to the ans quicklu
    if you find some issue midway, log it, but fix it after you are DONE ANSWERING HIS ORIGINAL QS.
4. comment when explaining approach, add step by step numbering
5. name methods as very non generic..be creative
6. always need to assume : interviewer has no common sense

meta axes:
1. problem solviing
2. coding
3. testing
4. communication
