Meta:
1. what are the axes to judge (any priority of them)?
    no priority
2. The way i explain while and after coding, is it acceptable?
3. when i have multiple approaches in mind, should i share all or only the optimal ones?
    time? if less time : optimal sol..
    depends if interviewer asks
4. when interviewer have suggested a particular approach and that is suboptimal than mine, should I
    mention it?
5. Verify our pattern/framework of interview.  
    do your dry run
5. is there a sample evaluation case file for a sample candidate?
5. am I allowed to use pen-paper ?
6. any topic bias for meta?

8. 


// strategy
do all meta tagged 150 past 6 months
follow framework.
metrics:
    all approaches should be talked about.
    code should be almost memorized
    should be doable like a robot with no glitch.
NOTE: my note should contain all possible solutions AND
    I should have them memorized fully.

    - get the resume formatting and prepare pitch (first 10 mins)
    - mention things (not necessarily on job...maybe something like trekking whetever..for me it can be tripwyz or may other things..this will show willingness to take difficult problem )
    - then pick past 1-3 project that i can talk very well and are great to mention
