7. dry run  [TIME : ]
    1. ask the interviewer :
        1. do you want specific tc to dry run, 
            1. yes, gives a big tc : 
                1. start detailed dry run for very short while, then jump through the dry run and mention:
                    'I will jump through iterations for the sake of time'
            2. yes, gives a small tc : goto step 7.1.1.1.1
            3. No
                1. try smallest case : step 7.1.1.1.1
                2. try small corner cases : step 7.1.1.1.1
                3. [optional] : try interesting edge case : step 7.1.1.1.1
                4. [optional] : try long edge case : step 7.1.1.1.1

6. explain : line by line explain the code
    1. first explain method wise
    2. then explain how methods are stiched
5 One Scan : [TIME : ]
    1. THIS IS VERY IMP. FOR YOU TO MENTALLY SOLVE CASES AND SEE CODE CORRECTNESS. AFTER THIS ANY MISTAKE FOUND IS A NEGATIVE MARK. 
    2. check hotspot ( and dry run in MIND)
    3. check variables, braces, ; , other syntaxes (all these per line). Speak : 'Now IM CHECKING FOR SYNTAX ERRORS'
4 start coding [TIME : ]
    1. try to use pseudo code's steps to decorate parts of code e.g. code sections or methods...AFTER that part is coded
    2. [optional] : whenever feel like some twisted logic is, add one liner comment 
    3. comment on top of each method on its role...also comment how multiple methods are linked
3. write and touch upon ideas one by one: [TIME : ]
    1. brute force (time and space complexity, data structure used,shortcomings)
    2. more optimal if any  (time and space complexity, data structure used,shortcomings)
    3. most optimal ..then mention 'i think this is most optimal that i can think of'  (time and space complexity, data structure used,shortcomings)
        1. then ask him 'are you looking for any specific approach'?
        2. if he says no :
            1. try to think of the approach, once done goto step 3.3
        3. if he says yes:
            1.  write pseudo code step  by step . Marking 1,2,3 etc.
            2. dry run basic and short cases
            3. ask him : " should we try corner cases now or after coding?"  
2. [TIME : ]
    1. ask and write size constrainst
    2. ask and write data types
    3. ask and write corner cases and output
1 write qs key points [TIME : ]
