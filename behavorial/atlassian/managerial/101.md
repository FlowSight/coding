1. How to prepare

Think about project(s) that best represent the scope of work where you have had measurable impact, learnt lessons and felt stretched. These projects don’t always have to be your best or most recent ones. In addition, think about times in your career where you have had to work together with other teammates, teams or customers to achieve meaningful outcomes together.

This will be a structured interview where we will ask questions that will dig into four primary areas:

1. Your ability to own outcomes, driving towards a team goal

2. How you have used your expertise to drive improvements

3. How you take initiative, leading to achieve positive change

4. Your contribution to the success of your team and organization
