- abhigna/ nikita

** situation**
- a relatively new joinee in team, N.
- they were assigned bugs, icms and smaller tasks
- some works lacked clarity, some didnt
- for more complicated work items they used to setup a call with myself, do a debugging session for an hour and fix it on call
- initially it was okay but later i observed a pattern where more complicated items on their queue were unacted upon until we debugged it together

**task**
- had to understand the reason for delay in resolving issues
- had to ensure this blind spot does not occur for other new joinees

**action**
- I checked in with them in order to  to gauge the knowlege they gained from previous debugging sessions, and how much effort had been put before debugging session.
- I asked them to 
    -go through past knowledge and debugging sessions, 
    - create learning doc for them, 
    - put debugging sessions in investigation samples in new joiner wiki
    - document the efforts and blockers reated to their investigation.
- With above I wanted to make them more independent and enrich our new joiner material.
- I refused the next debugging calls. I had setup small, more infrequent calls where i would just give them hints, listen to their navigation through the problem so far , nudge them a tad bit if required, even though I knew exact rootcause.
- I had shared a direct feedback in 1:1 with them that they needed to leverage past learnings and put in some extra effort before reaching out for help.

**result**
- they were able to rca that ICM.
- their speed of resolving critical bugs/icms increased
- we have a much enriched case studies set and new joiner material now
- they received the feedback positively and reflected gratitude in next connect session
- 2 more new joinees leveraged the framework and N was their onboarding buddy. They onboarded with zero hiccups.
