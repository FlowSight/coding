“Tell me about a time you handled unexpected challenges during a project.”

### **SITUATION**
- One area I’m actively improving is my tendency to take on too much myself towards the end of a project — jumping in to fix  **unexpected blockers**  — whether it was a CI/CD pipeline issue, a late-breaking PM requirement change, or an unplanned dependency from a partner team. 
- It comes from wanting to protect timelines and deliver commitments.

- In these moments, I’d often go into **“rescue mode”** — I’d silo myself, come up with unorthodox solutions, make aggressive calls, and push through just in time. While leadership appreciated the outcomes, it took a toll on me — both mentally and physically 

---

### **TASK**

I realized that my tendency to **vertically scale myself during chaos** wasn’t sustainable — and more importantly, it didn’t **build resilience into the team**.

So I made it a goal to:

* Reflect on and **deconstruct my own crisis responses and FIND A PATTERN**
* Help the team **anticipate and plan for uncertainty earlier**
* Shift from being a “rescuer” to being a **multiplier**

---

### **ACTION**

I went back and reviewed **three recent project : time copilot GA, time agent private and public previews** where I had made last-minute interventions — e.g., rolling out simultaneous PRs for multiple fix hypotheses, redeploying multiple times, kept many vms reserved for myself, reserving good commit branches ready, etc.

I then walked the team through these past patterns in a **feature planning meeting**, not to glorify the heroics — but to **highlight the common signs and missed warning cues** that led to late surprises. I asked the team to reflect and find their own ways to stay ahead of the chaos.

This included:

* Encouraging them to **push for early validation with partner teams**
* Identifying “risk multipliers” during grooming (e.g., volatile components or vague specs)
* Normalizing early prototyping or fallback planning
* designing with minimal dependency even if a solution exists in partner teams scope as a fallback

---

### **RESULT**

Since then, I’ve seen encouraging signs. For example:

* In a recent sprint, one teammate noticed an **undocumented telemetry change from MCS' teams telemetry in recent builds ** and proactively implemented a workaround, which we ended up adopting team-wide.
* I’ve had to intervene less frequently, and when I do, it’s often in collaboration — not isolation.

That said, I’m still working on it. In some cases, I still **fail to recognize risk early** — even after consulting SMEs — and I’m learning to get better at **seeking out help earlier instead of relying on grit**

This journey taught me that **leadership at scale isn’t just about delivering under pressure — it’s about enabling the team to see around corners.**

“In high-pressure moments — particularly toward the end of large deliveries — I’ve historically defaulted to going into a silo to unblock paths myself. My intent is to preserve delivery timelines and reduce churn, especially when ambiguity or unexpected issues arise. And while this often leads to successful outcomes, I’ve recognized that it can unintentionally reduce team visibility and shared problem-solving.

To address this, I’ve started treating past incidents as ‘case studies’ during planning — proactively sharing what went wrong and inviting the team to co-design risk mitigation strategies. For example, before our last wave, I walked the team through three prior projects where I had to stretch to land last-minute asks. That triggered a broader conversation around how to anticipate escalation patterns — and in one instance, a teammate surfaced an unannounced change and navigated it independently. That kind of shared ownership is what I want to scale.

I’m still learning to strike the right balance between urgency and alignment, but I’m much more intentional now about staying transparent under pressure and enabling the team to move as a unit.”


“What would your manager say about that?”
“They’d likely say I’m someone who will always ensure delivery — even if it means going above and beyond personally. But they’d also point out that I’ve sometimes over-relied on myself in those moments. We’ve discussed this, and they’ve supported me in shifting from being a ‘fixer’ to being a ‘multiplier.’ They’ve appreciated the way I’ve started building mechanisms for shared foresight and stronger risk communication across the team.”




- situation :
    Towards the end of a large 6+ sprin feature, when ad hoc adversaries arise such as build pipeline blocked, PM requirement change OR new ask from a partner team, I tend to go in my silo, make some unorthodox moves in my way, make plans ahead, and somehow make project meet the timeline. Although my leaderships appreciate this, this takes a toll on my health towards the end of every project due to me vertically scaling extremely and I am often unable to explain to my manager or peers why did I make those unorthodox moves
- Task :
    I need to be successful to make peer realize the need for finding a way to foresee risk of missed, deadline  and somehow formulate a way, brainstorm together a way to deal, instead of being reactive, dealing with concerns as they come.
- Action :
    I have taken past 3 projects that I led, making such moves towards the end where I had to stretch, take ad hoc routes, e.g. do multiple deployments, raise multiple PRs based on multiple fix hypothesis, and why did I do those. I explained this to team before feature planning urging people to take idea , find pattern and come up with their own way of staying ahead o things.
- Result : 
    although I see some improvements, in  specific instances I had to jump in. One occurrance was one teammate was able to find a unannounced feature changed and came up with his own workaround which we incorporated. I hope this will scale well and as a team we will be able to achieve more without me vertically scaling. But I still fail sometime to recognize early how a work can spiral even after discussing with SMEs.

    *Question: I like it but it is not technical or specific . Can ths work"xsss
