**Question:** Describe a time where you had a disagreement or conflict within your team.



TODO(CONCERN!!!!)
### **SITUATION**

I was leading the engineering effort for a private preview feature called **Time Entry Agent**, working with three junior engineers. While we had a committed timeline, we faced several blockers — CI/CD failures, dependency delays, and regressions — which jeopardized our estimates.

As the lead, I anticipated possible spillover. To protect the schedule, I quietly picked up tasks that were originally assigned to other engineers and finished them myself. We met the deadline, all happy — BUT a week later, my manager gave me feedback: **two teammates felt sidelined and expressed that I took over their work**, leaving them feeling **deprived of ownership**.


### **TASK**

I was surprised and a bit taken aback. My intentions were entirely around **project delivery**, not personal credit — but I understood their perspective. They were juniors, eager to grow, and I had unknowingly overridden that by solving things myself.

I had two choices:

* Confront it head-on in 1:1s, which could feel uncomfortable or even disingenuous.
* Or **course-correct through my actions** over time and rebuild trust by giving them **real ownership** in upcoming phases.

I chose the latter.

### **ACTION**

Post-release, I intentionally **delegated follow-up work** to the same engineers. While they worked on that, I started quietly shaping the **next release scope**, planning which items to prioritize and how to structure ownership.

When we started design discussions, I:

* **Involved them early** in design and estimation.
* Delegated **some of the harder pieces** — ones I would typically take on — to them.
* **Prioritized their items** first, so even in worst-case scenarios, they would ship and gain visibility.
* Made sure to **unblock them quickly** when needed — while keeping my own tasks light so I could co-dev or pair-program when they felt stuck.

Throughout, I ensured the message was clear: “I trust you with important work, and I’ve got your back.”


### **RESULT**

Not only did we **ship our public preview on time**, but the team dynamic improved significantly. Added benefit was 
items on my plate were finished pretty early.

Both teammates gave **positive feedback** post-release — using phrases like *“guiding,” “far-sighted,” and “someone I can learn from.”* My manager echoed this in skip-level feedback.

This experience reinforced something important for me:

> **Leadership isn’t just about delivering — it’s about making others feel empowered while delivering.**
