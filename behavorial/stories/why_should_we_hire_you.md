- I have worked with cohesity (series d startup), and microsoft (a trillion dollar company) i have worked on both extreme scale. I have shipped features on legacy codebase and completely clean slate. 
- I am keen in improving system performance. I had scaled time agent perf by 85% by scaling it to 200k users from ground up.
