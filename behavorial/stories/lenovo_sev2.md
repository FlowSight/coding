Prompt : tell me about the hardest problem you had solved

__

**Situation**
I led a CVP level visible product called Time entry copilot which lets enterprises enable their employees log,submit and approve their time entries automatically. Immediately after deployment to a critical geo, one of our biggest enterprise user was blocked on existing critical business processes such as submitting time entries,which led them to create a sev2.
**Task**
I had to introspect, figure out the RCA, and retrospect on how this went uncaught in multiple testing, int test etc. Do all these ASAP as more delay indicates customer quoting more business value loss which could make conversations harder among leadership.
**ACtion**
I started by trial-and error approach. Failing to navigate further, I resorted to a elimination based approach. When issue was pinpointed I realized our team's system does not have a check to prevent incorrect table schema metadata, but upstream data modelling team does. After reading codebase of the peer teams, I gathered a unorthodox fix and which worked.
**Result**







Absolutely ‚Äî we can reframe the **Result** to be more **success-driven**, not just about recovery, but about how you turned a high-risk failure into a **strategic win** for the customer, the product, and your leadership visibility.

Here‚Äôs your updated **story version**, with a more **success-oriented, proactive result**:

### üö© Question: *‚ÄúTell me about your biggest failure.‚Äù*

### ‚úÖ Story Format (Success-Driven Result)

Sure. One of the biggest failures I‚Äôve faced‚Äîand also one of the most valuable growth moments‚Äîhappened during the launch of a high-impact product I was leading called **Time Entry Copilot**. It‚Äôs designed to help enterprise users automate time logging, submission, and approval flows.

We had just rolled it out to a **mission-critical region (EMEA)**, and within hours, one of our **largest enterprise clients** raised a **Sev2 escalation**. Thousands of employees were **unable to submit time**, disrupting **payroll processing**, **billing**, and **regulatory reporting**. The client estimated **\$3.5M in potential downstream impact**, and leadership was deeply involved due to the visibility of the rollout.

Initially, I tried a few debugging approaches, but nothing surfaced the root cause. Realizing time was slipping and stakes were rising, I took a step back and shifted to a **structured elimination approach**. Eventually, I traced the issue to a **schema metadata mismatch**. Our system lacked validation for certain table schema changes‚Äîan assumption we had mistakenly made about upstream data hygiene.

What made this tough was that the validation logic existed‚Äîbut in a **different team‚Äôs system**. It wasn‚Äôt our bug, but it **was** our failure to account for the dependency.

I quickly dived into the upstream team‚Äôs codebase, figured out their schema handling logic, and implemented a **temporary but robust fix** within our system that validated metadata before processing. It was an unorthodox approach‚Äîtechnically outside our ownership boundary‚Äîbut it worked. The client was **fully unblocked within 6 hours**.

But what I‚Äôm most proud of is what followed.

I led the **post-incident review** with multiple teams and drove a long-term solution: a **shared schema validation contract** between systems, along with CI-level enforcement to block schema-breaking changes from reaching production.

We didn‚Äôt just recover from the failure‚Äîwe turned it into an opportunity to improve engineering quality across orgs. The client was not only satisfied‚Äîthey **publicly acknowledged our speed and ownership** in the next QBR, and chose to **accelerate** their rollout to two additional regions ahead of schedule.

Leadership later highlighted this incident as a **model example of customer obsession, cross-team collaboration, and high-ownership engineering**.

It taught me that while failures are inevitable, **how you respond defines your impact**. I now design every system I lead with an **assume-nothing, validate-everything mindset**, especially for flows that affect external customers.

### Summary of Success-Driven Results:

* ‚úÖ Fixed Sev2 issue in 6 hours, avoiding \$3.5M+ loss
* ‚úÖ Strengthened cross-team data contracts and CI/CD defenses
* ‚úÖ Retained and expanded a top-5 enterprise customer
* ‚úÖ Earned leadership and customer recognition
* ‚úÖ Elevated engineering practices across org boundaries
