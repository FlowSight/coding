Prompt : tell me about the hardest problem you had solved

__

**Situation**
I led a CVP level visible product called Time entry copilot which lets enterprises enable their employees log,submit and approve their time entries automatically. 
We had just rolled it out to a **mission-critical region (EMEA)**, and within hours, one of our **largest enterprise clients** raised a **Sev2 escalation**. Thousands of employees were **unable to submit time**, disrupting **payroll processing**, **billing**, and **regulatory reporting**. The client estimated **\$3.5M in potential downstream impact**, and leadership was deeply involved due to the visibility of the rollout.

**Task**
I had to introspect, figure out the RCA, and retrospect on how this went uncaught in multiple testing, int test etc. Do all these ASAP as more delay indicates customer quoting more business value loss which could make conversations harder among leadership.

**ACtion**
I started by trial-and error approach. Failing to navigate further, I resorted to a elimination based approach. When issue was pinpointed I realized our team's system does not have a check to prevent incorrect table schema metadata, but upstream data modelling team does. After reading codebase of the peer teams, I gathered a unorthodox fix and which worked.

**Result**

Customer concern was resolved within SLA. But I immediately consult peer architects and introduced few changes
1. Stopgap solution in our system to block incorrect schema in PR build/release pipeline.
2. Documentation on new learning including a case study of the customer issue
3. Introduce automated UI check to include this in release sign-off testing.
I reflected on some learnings for future:
1. Knowledge is lost across teams when we work in collaboration, we should look at dependency points and establish contracts with a rationale.
2. PR reviews can overlook mistakes. this can only be solved by automated code-coverage, which needs to be worked upon at scale. For which, a larger initiative needs to be taken to avoid this across codebase/teams.

Sure. One of the biggest failures I’ve faced—and also one of the most valuable growth moments—happened during the launch of a high-impact product I was leading called **Time Entry Copilot**. It’s designed to help enterprise users automate time logging, submission, and approval flows.



Initially, I tried a few debugging approaches, but nothing surfaced the root cause. Realizing time was slipping and stakes were rising, I took a step back and shifted to a **structured elimination approach**. Eventually, I traced the issue to a **schema metadata mismatch**. Our system lacked validation for certain table schema changes—an assumption we had mistakenly made about upstream data hygiene.

What made this tough was that the validation logic existed—but in a **different team’s system**. It wasn’t our bug, but it **was** our failure to account for the dependency.

I quickly dived into the upstream team’s codebase, figured out their schema handling logic, and implemented a **temporary but robust fix** within our system that validated metadata before processing. It was an unorthodox approach—technically outside our ownership boundary—but it worked. The client was **fully unblocked within 6 hours**.

But what I’m most proud of is what followed.

I led the **post-incident review** with multiple teams and drove a long-term solution: a **shared schema validation contract** between systems, along with CI-level enforcement to block schema-breaking changes from reaching production.

We didn’t just recover from the failure—we turned it into an opportunity to improve engineering quality across orgs. The client was not only satisfied—they **publicly acknowledged our speed and ownership** in the next QBR, and chose to **accelerate** their rollout to two additional regions ahead of schedule.

Leadership later highlighted this incident as a **model example of customer obsession, cross-team collaboration, and high-ownership engineering**.

It taught me that while failures are inevitable, **how you respond defines your impact**. I now design every system I lead with an **assume-nothing, validate-everything mindset**, especially for flows that affect external customers.
