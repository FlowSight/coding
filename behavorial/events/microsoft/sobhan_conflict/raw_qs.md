Q: Can you recall a situation where you faced a conflict at work?
A: It was during a delivery of a critical work with very tight deadline and very high visibility (directly to CVP).
The feature crew consisted of primarily 4 people (A(myself), B, C, D)  and 2 other people on and off.

B,C and D were juniors and I was leading the project.

There was a high priority (compliance related) work item which was started by myself and B. I led the planning and we together delivered the execution. But it was not concluded.

During a sprint, B and C  were on vacation. There was a work item which was quite urgent and the dependent team started following up, hence the urgency got escalated even more. I had to estimate, evaluate the remaining work and then decided to finish the task by dividing it among myself and the D. The work item was finished well within time with no major surprises.

The following week in sprint retro, my M1 highlighted the previous sprint's effort to leadership including this particular work item and crediting myself and D.

It only came later (3 months later) to my attention (by my manager) that, person B had complained about it to my manager that although D had finished it, B has started it. B also added that they see this as credit hogging on A's part as he was aware.

I had decided not to confront B, as it was clear to me that it is a case of clear miscommunication and bit of recency bias. 

Instead I decided to prove my support for them through actions. I started involving B more into the current ongoing project (Time Entry Agent). I started letting him plan and estimate smaller tasks while intervening as necessary. In case an item got picked up by B but the execution got delayed, I started asking if they need help. I made sure calling out B(and C ,D) for their contributions in sprint retro calls or other larger forums considering ALL their work without recency bias.

We, the same team, delivered the second phase of the project with success and B provided a very positive feedback for me, also got promoted.

Q: Could you tell me more about the compliance-related work item that you and B initially started - what was its purpose and scope?
A: 

Q: Since the candidate hasn't responded about the compliance work item, let me ask: What was the urgent work item that needed to be completed while B and C were on vacation?
A: Work item : Time Copilot  GA Language Expansion
Time copilot  was a LLM based feature, which we were about to publish for all non-english languages to customers(in public preview we did publish for english only) as a part of GA.

 It is mandatory in Microsoft to go through a process called DSB review where you need to prompt the LLM with unacceptable, borderline harmful content and verify if the results are blocked, filtered or neutral. Its a multi stage process with mix of automation and manual steps. 

DSB results need to be verified by a separate team called CELA, which is a checklist must have before rolling out a feature.

Q: What was the specific conflict between you and B regarding the credit for the Time Copilot GA Language Expansion work?
A: B complained about me to my manager that I took the credit of finishing the work.I in fact did finish the work with D, but what B is pointing to is he helped in past on some part of the work.

Q: When B initially helped with the Time Copilot work, what specific parts or tasks did they contribute to?
A: It was for english language DSB review during public preview of Time copilot. The non-english language DSB work item was completed based off that.

Q: When you discovered B's complaint about credit through your manager, what did you identify as the main issue that needed to be addressed?
A: Communication. My focus was always on completing the project. Although, It was true that I and D finished that work item, the fact that B helped in it previously should be highlighted as recency bias should be avoided.

Q: What specific changes did you make to your communication style or project management approach to prevent similar misunderstandings in the future?
A: 1. I let B plan and estimate smaller tasks, instead of directly assigning tasks to him. 
2. In every sprint retro or other larger forums, I called out B's (C and D as well) contribution to a task which got finished even if he had not worked on it recently.
3. I started taking B's feedback on if he would like the execution and planning to be done any differently.
4. Earlier I used to finish a task by myself if it was taking time from B, C or D. Now, I started to help B get unblocked and let him take it to closure (with few exceptions)
