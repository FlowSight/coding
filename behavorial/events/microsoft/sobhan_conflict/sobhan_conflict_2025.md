It was during a delivery of a critical work with very tight deadline and very high visibility (directly to CVP).
The feature crew consisted of primarily 4 people (A(myself), B, C, D)  and 2 other people on and off.

B,C and D were juniors and I was leading the project.

There was a high priority (compliance related) work item which was started by myself and B. I led the planning and we together delivered the execution. But it was not concluded.

During a sprint, B and C  were on vacation. There was a work item which was quite urgent and the dependent team started following up, hence the urgency got escalated even more. I had to estimate, evaluate the remaining work and then decided to finish the task by dividing it among myself and the D. The work item was finished well within time with no major surprises.

The following week in sprint retro, my M1 highlighted the previous sprint's effort to leadership including this particular work item and crediting myself and D.

It only came later (3 months later) to my attention (by my manager) that, person B had complained about it to my manager that although D had finished it, B has started it. B also added that they see this as credit hogging on A's part as he was aware.

I had decided not to confront B, as it was clear to me that it is a case of clear miscommunication and bit of recency bias. 

Instead I decided to prove my support for them through actions. I started involving B more into the current ongoing project (Time Entry Agent). I started letting him plan and estimate smaller tasks while intervening as necessary. In case an item got picked up by B but the execution got delayed, I started asking if they need help. I made sure calling out B(and C ,D) for their contributions in sprint retro calls or other larger forums considering ALL their work without recency bias.

We, the same team, delivered the second phase of the project with success and B provided a very positive feedback for me, also got promoted.



//////HI gist

I was leading a feature crew of four engineers working on Time Copilot, an LLM-based feature that was getting significant attention across the company. We were preparing for a critical milestone - expanding from English-only to supporting all non-English languages in our general availability launch. One of our team members, B, had valuable experience from the earlier English language review phase. However, we hit a challenging situation when both B and another engineer, C, had overlapping vacation time scheduled during a crucial sprint leading up to the launch.
