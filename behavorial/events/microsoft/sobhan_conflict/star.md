SITUATION:
- Led a feature crew of 4 people (3 juniors : B, C, D) working on Time Copilot, a high-visibility LLM-based feature
- Team was preparing for GA launch of Time Copilot to expand from English-only to all non-English languages
- Team member B had previously contributed to English language DSB review during public preview phase
- During a critical sprint, two team members (B and C) were on vacation.
- Needed to complete urgent DSB review for non-English languages
- Required to verify LLM responses to unacceptable content across multiple languages
- Had to meet CELA team requirements before feature rollout
- Had to manage the work with reduced team capacity due to vacations
- Evaluated remaining work and divided tasks between self and team member D
- Successfully completed the DSB review work within deadline.
- Manager announced successful completion of work in sprint retro meeting crediting me and D.
- Manager later (after a month of feature rollout) informed me about B's concern about credit hogging on my part and lack of recognition.

TASK :
- Clearing communication Gap with B.
- Make B believe in transparency by providing due credits and owning stuffs.
- With the above ensure next project's smooth delivery as the feature crew remained same.

ACITON
- When informed of B's concerns about credit attribution, chose not to confront but address through positive actions
- Modified leadership approach by involving B more in planning and estimation
- Implemented proactive support system by offering help when B faced execution delays
- Started explicitly recognizing all team members' contributions in sprint retros and larger forums, removing recency bias.
- Adjusted management style to enable team members to complete tasks rather than taking over
- 

RESULT:
- Successfully delivered new feature Time Agent on schedule
- Team successfully completed second phase of the project
- Received positive feedback from team member B
- B earned a promotion
- Strengthened team dynamics through improved communication and recognition practices
