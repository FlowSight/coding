SITUATION:
- Working on Project Operations Copilot, which consisted of two sub-projects: Project Copilot and Time Copilot
- Responsible for Time Copilot while working with a partner team managing Project Copilot
- Both teams shared a common copilot orchestration framework for LLM parameters and model deployments
- Had a tight timeline with release plan preponed to less than one week
- Needed to implement a new policy picker feature in the common code
- Had to modify the shared framework to support policy-based prompt generation
- Required to maintain functionality for both Time Copilot and Project Copilot teams
- Implemented a factory pattern for policy picker to create suitable prompts based on policies
- Made changes to common code with implicit constructor definition to maintain backward compatibility
- partner team engineer complained to manager, claiming he does not agree with the change and reverted entire change of mine.

TASK

ACTION:
- -proactively reached out to understand his concerns
- - After initial defensive response, adjusted approach by:
- - Including him as mandatory reviewer in common feature branch's policy
- - Informing him of all subsequent common code changes, even minor ones
- - Moving discussions to impromptu calls for direct feedback

RESULT:
- Established better communication patterns with the engineer
- He began providing direct feedback instead of indirect complaints
- Prevented future incidents of code reverts and delivery delays
- Created escalation process for unresolved conflicts through manager and M2 involvement
- Maintained productive working relationship while preserving ability to express differing opinions
- Improved collaboration process for shared codebase modifications
