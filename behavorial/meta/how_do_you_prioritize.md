- I admire Jeff bezos' philosophy, type1 and type2 decisions
 - typ1 : 10%, irreversible, must take together, cautiously
 - type2 : 90%, reversible, fast, take individually or delegate.

 “I start by clarifying the objective and success criteria — whether it’s a customer-facing impact, infra efficiency, or unblock for another team.

Then I look at all the tasks in terms of impact, urgency, and dependencies. I’m explicit about tradeoffs — for example, I’ll prioritize a task that unblocks multiple teams over something that has only local benefit.

I also factor in long-term impact. At Meta scale, it’s easy to get pulled into urgent-but-small wins, so I deliberately make space for work that reduces systemic bottlenecks, even if it’s less visible in the short term.

Finally, I keep priorities transparent and revisit them often — because context shifts quickly, and what was top priority yesterday may not be today. That way, stakeholders see the reasoning, not just the decision.”
