“I think my co-workers would describe me as 
    1. someone who is the fallback person in uncertain times, who digs deep to understand problems end-to-end, and who’s generous with technical context so others can make better decisions.
    2. another cohort might say my direction always help them stop reinventing the wheel and enable to moving fast, e.g. query from new joinees on fno or from sutanu on CE time entry submit flow.
    3. My agent team might also say that sometime I lack establishing the context before discussing a problem. I also switch context during within team debugging sessions that could be difficult for others where I need to streamline the discussion smoothly. They might also say I provide a bit too tight deadline for work items while sprint planning which might be difficult for people at times.
    4. My architects might say I strictly prefer data over debates, although some experiments might deem to  be unnecessary in their eyes. comparing load time of json vs fcs during HCE migration may not have added much value.

They might also say I’m persistent — I don’t stop at a quick patch if I know there’s a systemic issue underneath, but I still make sure the immediate business needs are met first.”
