- There are different situations where stress comes into play.   
    deadline meet pressue = time stress
     or unable to find the solution  : anticipatory stress
     job interview / presentation : situational stress
     introvert : encounter stress
    repeated diminishing return work : chronic stress

- I find anticipatory stress most occurring to me, which starts few days  before some deadline. 
    - I find working out reguarly which gives seratonin rush. 
    - Also taking ad hoc power naps help. 
    -for interview, stress is an simulator
- For time stress and chronic stress rewarding myself with some small, unknown dopamines help.
- situation :
    - I have been following the strategy for past 2 phases of time agent which I led. 
    - I measured at about 2 sprints before deadline, the stress starts to spike up.
    - I decided to celebrate smaller milestones of works.
- Task + action
    -  to keep the surprise element active I made a small bot in teams which I fed some resturants, activities, shows 
    - I would ask the bot to pick a activity for the team on friday night. We would take the latter half off.
- Result :
    - this resulted in tremendous synergy in myself and across team. I would even often find myself energetic to push some work on weekends
- My other vent out methods is : painting. It connects me to paper and brush, away from software world.
