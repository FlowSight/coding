    -How do you seek our opportunities

- - As meta's company-info page reads :"Build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible", even with ever growing AI adoption human connection will become even more relevant".  Not only to enable people to connect more but to tackle new problems that emerge. I strongly feel meta's b2c products adoption will only increase and with AI's emergence we need more sophisticated infra tools and better engineers who can leverage skill to design, AI to enable themselves to push the boundary of connectivity.

-  With Instagram at 500M DAUs and Facebook at over 2.1B DAUs,  they’ve become marketplaces, audiences, and communities powering business, freelancing, advertising, influencing, and campaigning. I’ve seen this firsthand — a couple of my close friends actually met their spouses through Facebook and Instagram, and even my neighbor adopted his dog after seeing a Facebook ad. That reach and real-world impact is unique, and I want to help strengthen the infrastructure that makes it possible.


“Meta operates some of the largest infra in the world — TAO for the social graph, RocksDB for storage, Presto and Scuba for analytics. These are systems where even a 1% efficiency gain translates into huge real-world impact. My strength has been in finding performance bottlenecks and optimizing large-scale distributed systems, and I see a direct opportunity to contribute to these technologies at Meta’s scale.”



- during most of the features I have delivered, the code review CI/CD pipeline has been a notorious blocker at critical times in microsoft and earler and often times I had to suggest or provide fixes. Im interested in how meta handles it via fabricator and how outage and auth,provision and failures are tackled.

- Having worked at legacy system a bit, I am familiar with the pain of understanding
context of a old codebase, debugging inside and sanitizing and refactoring it. Ive heard about how meta has “Better Engineering” initiatives where 14% PRs are for code improvements and diff authoring time (DAT) per file (highest normalized DAT files are reauthored first). I would enjoy to contribute to that effort.

- whats in for me
- whats in for them




- not sure if gonna join yet, looking forward to learn more
-  I’m drawn to studying the evolution of hot paths, understanding why certain code is difficult to refactor
- tooling : cicd pipeline issue in msft, how meta handles it via fabricator and how outage and auth,provision and failures are tackled

- points to bring up
    - compliance process in microsoft -> slow moving V/S Meta moves fast
    - Meta’s “Better Engineering” initiatives
        - https://arxiv.org/html/2504.12517v1 : Jump from  4% to 14% diff in meta are devoted to code improvement
        - diff authoring time (DAT) per file : highest normalized DAT files are reauthored first
        - Knowledge loss
    - logarithm 
    - meta scale history
        - fb
        - insta
        - llama

- info
    - meta code review powered by 'Phabricator'
    - meta is rewriting java to kotlin
    - logarithm is being improved to support structured data, improve search-filter-sort latency, I;ve worked on similar


- question to mock guide
    - whats the ideal ans to this qs?


*interviewer feedback : speak how are you aligned with meta's vision and their products. 
Add personal reason : social connect . power of social media, products which social media is building can help mankind.believing in the vision of what meta does . your believes vs meta's . your experience vs metas
