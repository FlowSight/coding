https://interviewing.io/blog/how-software-engineering-behavioral-interviews-are-evaluated-meta

    rubrics:
    - Motivation*: What drives them? Ideal candidates are self-motivated, passionate about technologies and products that have a real impact.
    - Ability to be Proactive: Are they able to take initiative? Given a difficult problem, are they able to figure out how to get it done and execute?
    - Able to work in an unstructured environment*: How well are they able to take ownership in ambiguous situations? Or do they rely on others to be told what to do?
    - Perseverance*: Are they able to push through difficult problems or blockers?
    - Conflict Resolution*: How well are they able to handle and work through challenging relationships?
    - Empathy*: How well are they able to see things from the perspective of others and understand their motivations?
    - Growth*: How well do they understand their strengths, weaknesses and growth areas? Are they making a continued effort to grow?
    - Communication*: Are they able to clearly communicate their stories during the interview?


- questions mainly asked
    - tell me about urself
    - conflict (maxim)
    - most impact 
    - failure/mistake (lenovo sev2)
    - hardest problem solved
    - worked in ambiguity (ryan)
    - Can you describe a situation where you had to work with a decision that you didn't agree with? (hce)
    - Can you give an example of a valuable piece of feedback that you have received?
    - How would your co-workers describe you?
    - why want to change
        - why meta
    - how do you use teammates
    - You can expect to be asked "What would you like to do at Meta? so be prepared to talk about specific interests of yours and how they relate to Meta as a tech company and/or product. (TODO)
    - How do you seek our opportunities? (we really like candidates who are proactive at fixing/improving things) (TODO)*****



- questions



If things aren't going to plan, how do you move yourself/your projects forward? (TODO)


We are looking for go-getters / people who can direct themselves and seek out opportunities. Think of some examples where you have been proactive on seeking out opportunities/solving problems without being told to do this. (TODO : time agent scale issue/copilot regression check while in EC)*****



questions:

1. about 'how do you do...', is there a star like structure? do I have to ans with a situation?
2. how many stories are good enough ? 4-5
    2-3 big examples

our framework
- sitation : bg story, how did i land up in story, 
- task: why did i do it, why no other alternative
- action : what and how
- result : outcome


Got it 👍 — you’re looking for **idioms / catchy phrases** that fit the vibe of technical rounds (interviews, system design, coding discussions), similar to *“tried and true,” “going south,” “data over debates,” “replicate in any flavour.”*

Here’s a curated list you could use naturally in technical conversations:

---

### General Problem-Solving / Reliability

* **Tried and tested** → proven approach that works reliably.
* **Don’t reinvent the wheel** → don’t build something from scratch if a solution already exists.
* **If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it** → don’t over-engineer.
* **Battle-tested** → code/system that has stood real-world stress.
* **Fail fast, fix faster** → quick iteration and debugging mindset.

---

### Risk / Failure

* **Going south** → things failing or worsening.
* **Single point of failure** → risky dependency.
* **On thin ice** → fragile or risky implementation.
* **The devil is in the details** → tricky bugs hidden in small details.
* **House of cards** → system that may collapse under pressure.

---

### Data-Driven / Engineering Culture

* **Data over debates** → let metrics drive decisions.
* **Numbers don’t lie** → trust measurable performance.
* **In God we trust, all others bring data** → classic engineering phrase.
* **Measure twice, cut once** → plan and verify before implementing.
* **Proof of the pudding is in the eating** → test in real usage.

---

### Flexibility / Scaling

* **Replicate in any flavour** → adaptable, modular solution.
* **Plug and play** → easy integration.
* **Scale on demand** → grows with load.
* **Future-proof** → designed for longevity.
* **One size doesn’t fit all** → design should consider variation.

---

### Debugging / Problem Analysis

* **Root cause analysis** → get to the bottom of an issue.
* **Needle in a haystack** → elusive bug.
* **Peel the onion** → debug layer by layer.
* **Smoke and mirrors** → code looks like it works but doesn’t under the hood.
* **Silver bullet (or lack thereof)** → no single fix solves everything.

👉 Would you like me to **make a compact “cheat sheet” of these idioms** (grouped by theme) that you can quickly glance at before interviews?
