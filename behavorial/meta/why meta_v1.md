    -How do you seek our opportunities

###Vision alignment points###:
- As meta's company-info page reads :"Build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible",  with ever growing AI adoption human connection will become even more relevant.  Not only to enable people to connect more but to tackle new problems that emerge with AI. I strongly feel meta's b2c products adoption will only increase and with AI's emergence we need more sophisticated infra and more 10x engineers who can help develop this by leveraging AI combined with skill.

###My experience alignment points###
 - My strength has been in finding performance bottlenecks and optimizing large-scale distributed systems. I scaled Time agent in Microsoft from 1k to 50k users and implemented source side deduplication in Cohesity to bring down upload time by 40%. In Meta scale systems where even a 0.1% efficiency gain translates 100ks of users impact, I see a direct opportunity to contribute.

-- unless asked---
I could give some...
- ###specific examples###:
- during most of the features I have delivered, the code review CI/CD pipeline has been a notorious blocker at critical times in microsoft and earler and often times I had to suggest or provide fixes. Im interested in how meta handles it via fabricator and how different aspects like auth, diff scale group, incremental build are tackled.

- Having worked at legacy systems, I am familiar with the pain of understanding
context of a old codebase, debugging inside and sanitizing and refactoring it. Ive heard about how meta has “Better Engineering” initiatives where 14% PRs are for code improvements using a a metric called  DAT (diff authoring time) per file (highest normalized DAT files are reauthored first). I would enjoy to contribute to that effort.

- I faced challenges and used workarounds in fetching unstructured metrics for the features I led in Microsoft due to lack of indexes and support for unstructured data. I learnt meta is improvding Logarithm to support unstructued data and improve search-filter-sort latency. Would be interested to learn the approach being taken and contribute.

- ###personal note###:  With Instagram at 500M DAUs and Facebook at over 2.1B DAUs,  they’ve become marketplaces, audiences, and communities powering business, freelancing, advertising, influencing, and campaigning. I’ve seen this firsthand — a couple of my close friends actually met their spouses through Facebook and Instagram, and even my neighbor adopted his dog after seeing a Facebook ad. That reach and real-world impact is unique, and I want to help strengthen the infrastructure that makes it possible.

- whats in for me
- whats in for them

“Meta operates some of the largest infra in the world — TAO for the social graph, RocksDB for storage, Presto and Scuba for analytics. 


- 
-  I’m drawn to studying the evolution of hot paths, understanding why certain code is difficult to refactor
- tooling : cicd pipeline issue in msft, how meta handles it via fabricator and how outage and auth,provision and failures are tackled

- points to bring up
    - compliance process in microsoft -> slow moving V/S Meta moves fast
    - Meta’s “Better Engineering” initiatives
        - https://arxiv.org/html/2504.12517v1 : Jump from  4% to 14% diff in meta are devoted to code improvement
        - diff authoring time (DAT) per file : highest normalized DAT files are reauthored first
        - Knowledge loss
    - logarithm 
    - meta scale history
        - fb
        - insta
        - llama

- info
    - meta code review powered by 'Phabricator'
    - meta is rewriting java to kotlin
    - logarithm is being improved to support structured data, improve search-filter-sort latency, I;ve worked on similar


- question to mock guide
    - whats the ideal ans to this qs?


*interviewer feedback : speak how are you aligned with meta's vision and their products. 
Add personal reason : social connect . power of social media, products which social media is building can help mankind.believing in the vision of what meta does . your believes vs meta's . your experience vs metas
