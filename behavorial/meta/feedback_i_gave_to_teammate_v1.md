** situation**
- a relatively new joinee in team, N.
- they were assigned bugs, icms and smaller tasks
- some works lacked clarity, some didnt
- for more complicated work items they used to setup a call with myself, do a debugging session for an hour and fix it on call
- initially it was okay but later i observed a pattern where more complicated items on their queue were unacted upon until we debugged it together

**task**
- had to understand the reason for delay in resolving issues
- had to ensure this blind spot does not occur for other new joinees

**action**
- I checked in with them, tried to gauge the knowlege they gained from previous debugging sessions, and how much effort had been put before debugging session.
- I asked them to go through past sessions, create learning doc for them, put them in investigation samples in new joiner wiki
- I refused the next debugging calls. I had setup small, more infrequent calls where i would just give them hints, even though I knew exact rootcause.
- I had shared a direct feedback in 1:1 with them that they needed to leverage past learnings and put in some extra effort before reaching out for help.

**result**
- their speed of resolving critical bugs/icms increased
- we have a much better case studies set now
- they received the feedback positively and mentioned in during next connect session
- 2 more new joinees leveraged the framework and N was their onboarding buddy.
