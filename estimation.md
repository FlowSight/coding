backward estimation

sd :
    HI : 8 rem : 1st pass
    Alexxu : 15 rem 1st pass
    total = 23 days
    need 3 pass HI + alexxu = 23 + 15 = 38 items
        = 1 day 2 passes = 19 days for 1 pass = 57 days = 2 months

    record while giving mocks (to myself, to sumita , to someone else)
    new topics : revision = 1:1 (do at once)

coding:
    need (meta tagged + nc 150 ) in hand
    avg solve per day = 3 qs
    meta tag : need to do full 1 time + 2/3 1 time + 1/3 1 time =
            = 600/3 + 600*(0.66)/3 + 600/3/3
            = 200 + 132 + 66
            = 400 days??


        approach 2:

            3 months = 400
            hard only = 50
            1 pass = 50/3 per day = 17 days
            med only = 228


    nc 150 = 1/3 2 times = 50/3*4 = 66 days

    <!-- 1/3 1 time means = see 3 random qs..do 1.
    2/3 1 time means = see 3 random qs..do 1. -->

    see a qs : if doesnt hit within 10 mins..see solution..node down..move on

behavorial
need proper behavorial = need all qs ans reharsed = need story - lp mapping
story create = 5 days (basic) + ongoing(continuous)
mapping create = 5 days (basic) + ongoing(continuous)
structuring = 5 days (basic) + ongoing(continuous)
reharse = 10 days (min)
= 25 days

////////////////
- code
    - state : need to reach  a state where i can do hards in 20 mins..and covered a lot of hards..in LC and codeforces..
    - few qs arises from above statement:
        - how many hards..
        - how many from Lc and codeforces..
        - how to measure/estimate time taken to reach at the state of solving under 20 mins..
    - current state : 
        - blind75 : done at least 2 times
        - neetcode 150(>50% complete) : need revision
        - company wise :
            - meta (started)
            - amazon, google, atlassin,uber : remaining
    - immediate goal : 
        - rationale : to collate new qs + company wise qs we can
            go either topic wise or company wise..company wise makes more sense as Ive got sufficient depth topic wise already 
        - topics where im weaker :
            - bit
            - graph hard
            - greedy
            - dp
        - company wise remaining:
            - meta 6 months
            - google : 6 months
            - atlassian : 6 months
            - uber : 6 months
        - do company wise prioritizing above topics..
            - how : for every 5 qs solved, 3 should be from above topics
    - estimation :
        - if I do avg 4 qs a day..
            - meta : 535
            - uber : 92
            - salesforce : 52
            - total : 600
            - even considering 25% done earlier, 450 new
            - 100 days = 4 months
    - need to code with thread safety (continuous practice)
        


sd
    - hellointerview:  5 deep dive + 22 topics
    - alexxu : 4+10(in new book) = 14 topics
    - revision from hello interview + alexxu + grokking + gaurav sen 

    - speed = 1 topic/day => 36 days + revision(20) = 60 days


lld
    - 1 week for read up
    - 2 week for code


LP 
    - at least 30 qs
    - steps:
        - put incidents (7 days+rest later)
        - map incidents to stories ( 2 weeks)
        - total = 1 month

max(all above) = 4 months = May end
