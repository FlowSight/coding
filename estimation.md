 sumita :
    coding:
        nc 150 :TODO(revise)
        meta 1 month easy : 42
        per day : 2 meta code + 3 random nc visit, if feel iffy, do it 
        meta = 42/2 = 21
        nc 150 = 150/3 = 50
        max(meta , nc 150) = 50
    sd : 
        first pass :
            HI :
                qs breakdown : 18 rem + 5 done
                key tech: 7 (done)
            alex xu : 7 rem
            HI 18 rem = 18*1.5 = 27
            alex xu : 7*1.5 = 11
            time to finish 1st round = 38

        second pass:
            revision = 23 (HI) + 7 key tech (HI)  = 30 = 30 days
                alex xu notes will be INSIDE HI notes, so revision separtely not needed

    total = max(sd, coding) = max(50,68) = 68


// 16 apr 2025

meta interview in 1 month
i need to cover and put  in finger tip meta last 3 months med + hard
also finger tipify nc150
nc150 2nd pass deadline : 20 apr
meta 3 months med/hard : 
    tot : 271
    hard done : 39/51
    med done : 10/220

    hard rem : 12
    med rem : 210
    tot rem : 222

    solving each qs = 222/30 = 7 /day..impossible
    have to read/mentally solve easier ones
    maybe 100 actually-solve and 122 soft-solve 
        = feasible as 3/day avg for 30 days

but nc150 needs revision as well. at least 2 times
4 days per revision = 8 days
total becoming 38 days.

need to schedule HI paid mocks.
need to start personal mocks

1. I mock myself (start today 16/4/25)
2. sumita mocks me (start after 20/4/25)
3. HI mocks me (in may first week).

practice method:
    for meta tagged:
        1. give 15 min and 5 mins buffer. Whatever state it is in 20 mins..stop it. mark it as fail and reason of failure. Move ahead.
        2. 3 hr = 9 slots of 20 mins..at least 7 qs should be done. 20*2=40 mins buffer time.
    nc150 method:
        1. see questions, if the qs feels iffy, do it, similar 15+5=20 mins.
        2. above is bound to 1 hr.
        3. every nth revision of nc150 will be doing from a subset of qs
            selected from (n-1)th revision where I stumbled. The goal of nth iteration is to reduce the list. In nth iteration i will soft solve all 150, solve iffy ones and keep in new list. hope
            is this list size will go down.

==============================
5 apr 2025


///// checkpointing (anirban)
nc 150 done
HI 17 done
meta tagged hard 10 done (??? in doubt as shared account)


///// target checkpointing on 20 apr 2025
HI done : 1 pass
nc 150 in muscle memory
behavorial : at least 10 stories prepared

sumita:
HI : 4 qs breakdown + all key tech
LC : meta tagged medium = 30 done



/// backward estimation (anirban)

sd :
    HI : 8 rem : 1st pass
    Alexxu : 15 rem 1st pass
    total = 23 days
    need 3 pass HI + alexxu = 23 + 15 = 38 items
        = 1 day 2 passes = 19 days for 1 pass = 57 days = 2 months

    record while giving mocks (to myself, to sumita , to someone else)
    new topics : revision = 1:1 (do at once)

coding:
    need (meta tagged + nc 150 ) in hand
    avg solve per day = 3 qs
    meta tag : need to do full 1 time + 2/3 1 time + 1/3 1 time =
            = 600/3 + 600*(0.66)/3 + 600/3/3
            = 200 + 132 + 66
            = 400 days??


        approach 2:

            3 months = 400
            hard only = 50
            1 pass = 50/3 per day = 17 days
            med only = 228= 

        I wil do only hard+meta+3months
        sumita wil do only medium+meta+3months


    nc 150 = 1/3 2 times = 50/3*4 = 66 days

    <!-- 1/3 1 time means = see 3 random qs..do 1.
    2/3 1 time means = see 3 random qs..do 1. -->

    see a qs : if doesnt hit within 10 mins..see solution..node down..move on

behavorial
need proper behavorial = need all qs ans reharsed = need story - lp mapping
story create = 5 days (basic) + ongoing(continuous)
mapping create = 5 days (basic) + ongoing(continuous)
structuring = 5 days (basic) + ongoing(continuous)
reharse = 10 days (min)
= 25 days

============================


- code
    - state : need to reach  a state where i can do hards in 20 mins..and covered a lot of hards..in LC and codeforces..
    - few qs arises from above statement:
        - how many hards..
        - how many from Lc and codeforces..
        - how to measure/estimate time taken to reach at the state of solving under 20 mins..
    - current state : 
        - blind75 : done at least 2 times
        - neetcode 150(>50% complete) : need revision
        - company wise :
            - meta (started)
            - amazon, google, atlassin,uber : remaining
    - immediate goal : 
        - rationale : to collate new qs + company wise qs we can
            go either topic wise or company wise..company wise makes more sense as Ive got sufficient depth topic wise already 
        - topics where im weaker :
            - bit
            - graph hard
            - greedy
            - dp
        - company wise remaining:
            - meta 6 months
            - google : 6 months
            - atlassian : 6 months
            - uber : 6 months
        - do company wise prioritizing above topics..
            - how : for every 5 qs solved, 3 should be from above topics
    - estimation :
        - if I do avg 4 qs a day..
            - meta : 535
            - uber : 92
            - salesforce : 52
            - total : 600
            - even considering 25% done earlier, 450 new
            - 100 days = 4 months
    - need to code with thread safety (continuous practice)
        


sd
    - hellointerview:  5 deep dive + 22 topics
    - alexxu : 4+10(in new book) = 14 topics
    - revision from hello interview + alexxu + grokking + gaurav sen 

    - speed = 1 topic/day => 36 days + revision(20) = 60 days


lld
    - 1 week for read up
    - 2 week for code


LP 
    - at least 30 qs
    - steps:
        - put incidents (7 days+rest later)
        - map incidents to stories ( 2 weeks)
        - total = 1 month

max(all above) = 4 months = May end
