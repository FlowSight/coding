Problem: Transaction Fees (Per-(Merchant, Provider) Fee Waiver After Threshold)
You are given a sequence of transactions. Each transaction has:

merchant_id
provider_id (payment provider)
amount (integer)
A fee is charged on each transaction. You need to add a new rule:

If a merchant’s cumulative transaction amount on a given provider becomes strictly greater than 10000, then all subsequent transactions for that (merchant, provider) pair incur zero fee.

Implement a program that processes transactions in input order and outputs the fee for each transaction.

Base fee rule
fee = floor(amount * 0.02) (2% rounded down)
If the transaction is fee-waived, fee = 0.
Waiver condition (important)
The threshold is tracked separately per (merchant_id, provider_id).
When the cumulative amount first becomes > 10000:
The transaction that crosses the threshold is still charged normally.
Waiver starts from the next transaction for the same (merchant, provider).
Input (stdin)
First line: integer n.
Next n lines: merchant_id provider_id amount.
Output (stdout)
Print n lines, each the fee (integer) for that transaction.
Constraints
1 <= n <= 2e5
1 <= amount <= 1e9
merchant_id and provider_id are strings without spaces.
