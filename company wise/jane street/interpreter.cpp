//  Given the signature to a regular expression parser (perl style), 
// give the implementation. The function 'match' should return the first match of an expression within
// a string and a new function 'more' that you can use to successively
 //iterate all possible matches. You have 45 minutes to write this on a 
 //white board.

// Keys: Once you are able to match a range of characters (e.g. [A-Z]),
//  use this over and over. Decide early on whether * and + are greedy or non-greedy.
