// Task Description
// Design a 2D board simulator with two types of pieces.

// Tasks
// Class Design: Design a class to represent the board and implement the functionality to add pieces.
// Pieces are added from the bottom of the board.
// Adding a piece causes all existing pieces in that column to shift upwards.
// Column Check: After adding a piece, check if there's any column filled entirely with the same type of piece.
// Row Check: After adding a piece, check if there's any row filled entirely with the same type of piece.
// Constraints & Assumptions
// Board size is m x n.
// Two types of pieces (e.g., 'X' and 'O', or 0 and 1).
// Deliverables
// Board class implementation.
// Example code demonstrating initialization and basic operations (adding pieces, checking win conditions).


board size given : yes, m x n
0, 1
only row and col check : yes

solution :
1. use dll
