// Implement a backend version of Connect4. Here are the requirements:

// Board has 6 rows, 7 columns
// Two player game
// Players take turns dropping pieces in the board. When a piece is dropped, it falls as close to the bottom as possible (imagine inserting a chip in physical connect 4)
// A win happens if you have 4 in a row, in a column or in diagonal. Game terminates when win condition is met
