- code
    - neetcode 150 : 30 rem = 10 days
    - company wise : todo
    - 450 new = 112 days
    -  122 days
    - 4 months = 10 july
    - need to make it better : 
        - maybe pic meta 3 months..
        - there might be some overlap in comapny wise and topic wise..

- sd :
    - very tough it seems
    - 16 topics in HI..I need to do each topic 1 day..= 16 days..=within march..why ? because i will need to revise anyway
    - alexxu : 15 ish topics : 15 days more: some has overlap with HI..
    - strategy : while doing HI or alexxu, refer to only THAT source..dont mix up..will revise anyway..so just make notes as per that source..write down qs that you have..
    - so 1 basic+ initial round = 35 ish days 
    - if i add them after coding end date : august 1st week..tough..

- i need to interleave coding+sd..
- lets make march goal:
    - 20 more days
    - 3-5 days very less productive
    - 15-17 days
    - alt code and sd days
    - 10 code + 7 sd = 50 code + 7 sd = nc 150 finish  + 20 from meta done + 7 from HI done
    - need 10 stories : LP mapping
MArch 31 goal :
    - nc 150 finish  + 20 from meta done + 7 from HI done
    - need 10 stories : LP mapping
